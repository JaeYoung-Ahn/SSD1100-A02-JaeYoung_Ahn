            I enrolled in <a href="https://www.bcit.ca/programs/software-systems-developer-certificate-full-time-7120cert/">BCIT's SSD program</a> because of my passion for technology and my desire to create innovative solutions. Having studied Front-End Web Development (FWD), I saw the SSD program as an excellent opportunity to enhance my skills. The program's comprehensive curriculum and hands-on approach were major factors in my decision to join.

            My goal in this program is to deepen my understanding of software architecture, agile methodologies, and full-stack development. After completing the SSD program, I hope to secure a position as a software developer in a forward-thinking tech company where I can contribute to meaningful projects. Ultimately, I aspire to become a senior developer and potentially start my own software consultancy firm, leveraging the knowledge and experience gained from this program.
